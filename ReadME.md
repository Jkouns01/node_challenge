<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p> In this project I was able to learn how to write node js. this has been by far the most fun I have had in this bootcamp. The idea of this project was to maje a questionaire that asked you questions for a neat README file. I did make it work until I added the checkbox question. I will resubmit a fixed verion in the future.</p>
